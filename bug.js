This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  This commonly happens when the cleanup function tries to access or modify a component's state or props after the component has unmounted.  The error might not be immediately obvious because it happens during the cleanup phase, after the component is already gone.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('some_url');
        const json = await response.json();
        setData(json);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchData();

    return () => {
      // This cleanup function might throw an error if the component is unmounted before this runs
      console.log('Cleaning up...');
      if (data) {
        // Problematic line if component has unmounted before the cleanup function is called
        setData(null); //Error might not be thrown here but in later functions using 'data'
      }
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* ... */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
